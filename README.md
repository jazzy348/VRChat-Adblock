# VRChat-Adblock
A PiHole list for blocking known ad and tracking networks I've stumbled across while exploring VRChat.

This will only block networks that actively tracks players or serves ads. Networks serving posters or artworks will not be placed on this list.

If something is missing feel free to open a pull request for me to review. Be sure to include a reason and any evidence which backs up why you believe a particular domain or network needs to be blocked. Not all third party services are evil!
